**Overview**

This project provides an end-to-end test automation framework for the Spree Commerce platform, built using Playwright with Java and TestNG. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and includes integrated reporting features. A workflow is also defined within the project to allow automated test execution to be triggered easily.
